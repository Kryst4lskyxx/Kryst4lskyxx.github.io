## Background

See original post of DEWU TECH in [Cursor Rules Optimization: Building an Efficient and Stable Specification System for AI Code Generation](https://tech.dewu.com/article?id=183).

## Result
A set of Cursor rules are generated by `Cursor` itself in [cursor_rules_example](https://github.com/Kryst4lskyxx/cursor_rules_example) by feeding Cursor the original post using refined prompt with [PromptPilot](https://promptpilot.volcengine.com/).
